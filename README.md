# Agenda CRUD

This project was developed with the goal of learning to implement a CRUD system (Create, Read, Update, Delete). I used Node.js and Express to build the application.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new records to the database.
- **Read:** View stored records.
- **Update:** Edit information of existing records.
- **Delete:** Remove records from the database.

4. After configuring the .env, start the server with the command: npm run dev
